Bygone is a game I'm developing to help the next generation learn about neurodiversity and deeper life topics such as mercy and forgiveness. The project is fully open source, with all original graphics, voice acting, sound effects and music. I am open to contributions so longs as they are up to stylistic standards and make sense in the context of the game. Please open an issue to discuss your ideas before contributing code or otherwise.
